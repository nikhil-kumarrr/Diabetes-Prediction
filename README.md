# Diabetes Risk Prediction System
An AI-powered healthcare web application built with Streamlit to predict diabetes risk using patient health indicators.
The system provides both a risk category and a probability-based risk score with an interactive visual interface.

##  Features
- Machine Learning–based diabetes risk prediction
- Probability-driven risk assessment with visual risk bar
- Modern healthcare-themed UI with animations
- Real-time prediction using trained ML model
- Responsive and clean Streamlit layout

## How It Works
- The application takes key patient health inputs such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, age, and medical history.
- A trained classification model processes this data and:
     #### Predicts diabetes risk (Low / Moderate / High)
     #### Outputs a probability score visualized through an interactive risk bar
The entire pipeline runs locally with no external API dependency.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib
- Custom CSS (Healthcare UI & animations)
